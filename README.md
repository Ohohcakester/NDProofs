NDProofs
========

Tool for constructing using Natural Deduction (CS1231).  
This closely follows the Natural Deduction as it is taught in the NUS Module CS1231 Discrete Structures.

NDProofs is a tool used to quickly and easily build and check proofs using the principles of Natural Deduction. It speeds up the process of planning and making a proof through an interface that allows the quick editing and checking of each line as you construct the proof.  
In addition, inbuilt features like hints, and logic checking can prompt you or ensure that you are on the right track.


Features
=======
- Importing / exporting or proofs from a text file
- Automatic verification of proofs.
- Custom puzzle packs
- Custom natural deduction rules
- Automated truth-table checking of statements (runs in exponential time. No problem for <10 variables)


Installation
=======
No installation is required. Just compile and run.
